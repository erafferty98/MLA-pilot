# MLA Fitness App

A simple and interactive fitness tracking application built with multiple microservices and programming languages. This application allows users to track their exercises and monitor their progress over time.

The Activity Tracking functionality uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the Analytics service uses Python/Flask and the Authentication Microservice using Java.

### Current Features

- User registration for personalized tracking
- Log various types of exercises with descriptions, duration, and date
- See weekly and overall statistics
- Interactive UI with Material-UI components
- Real-time data persistence with MongoDB

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn
- Python Flask
- Java 8
  (all already installed in the devcontainer)

## Development in Github Codespaces

#### Starting a new Devcontainer

1. Click on "Code"
2. Switch to the "Codespaces" tab
3. Create new Codespace from main

#### Check needed packages are installed:

```sh
sh .devcontainer/check-installation.sh
```

expected output:

```

if you're missing any version, please contact your course administrator.

### Building entire project with Docker (+ starting containers up)

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

### Start existing containers (no rebuild of images)

```sh
docker compose up
```

#### Spinning up a single service

```sh
docker compose up [servicename]
```

#### Shutting down a service

```sh
docker compose down [servicename]
```

#### Docker Prune (complete refresh)
'''
docker system prune --all --force --volumes
'''

## Development without using Docker-Compose

#### Running Node.js Activity Tracker

```sh
cd activity-tracking
npm install
nodemon server
```

#### Running Flask application

```sh
cd analytics
flask run -h localhost -p 5050
```

#### Running Java application

```sh
cd authservice
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew bootRun
```

#### Start the Frontend

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

#### spin up MongoDB without docker-compose:

```
docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 -v mongodbdata:/data/db mongo:latest
```

### Connect to MongoDB

```
mongosh -u root -p cfgmla23 --authenticationDatabase admin --host localhost --port 27017
```

show registered activities:

```
db.exercises.find()
```

show registered users:

```
db.users.find()
```

## Deployment

The application is containerized using Docker and can be deployed on any platform that supports Docker containers. For AWS deployment, a GitHub Actions pipeline is configured for CI/CD.

## Tyk

By default, the services are run behind [Tyk](https://tyk.io/) (used as an API Gateway & Reverse Proxy). Tyk is configured in the ./tyk folder, where each api has a config file (eg tyk/apps/auth). Here we configure which requests to tyk we match to this api, where we forward them on to and any middleware that is applied.

To access TYK, the frontend/orchestration needs to use an API Key. This is set as `TYK_API_KEY` in the .env for the frontend, and is set as a header on all requests to tyk. This means that all requests to our services are fully secured through auth, as requests can only get to the service via tyk, and the only way to get the api key is to send a request to the frontend/orchestration with a valid auth token.

If Tyk is giving errors in the logs like `connect: connection refused`, you may need to generate a new api key and place it in the env file for the frontend. To do this, use the cUrl command in the tyk folder, and paste the value of the "key" output as the api key.

## Grafana & Prometheus

All services and the frontend send metrics to Prometheus, and are displayed on a Grafana dashboard. The dashboard is stored as a json file in the `grafana` folder for easy local development.
